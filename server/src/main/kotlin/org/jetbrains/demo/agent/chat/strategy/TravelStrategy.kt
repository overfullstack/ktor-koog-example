                Give it a brief, catchy title that doesn't include dates, but may consider season, mood or relate to travelers's interests.

                Plan the journey to minimize travel time.
                However, consider any important events or places of interest along the way that might inform routing.
                Include total distances.

                Consider the weather in your recommendations. Use mapping tools to consider distance of driving or walking.

                Write up in $WORD_COUNT words or less.
                Include links in text where appropriate and in the links field.
                
                The Day field locationAndCountry field should be in the format <location,+Country> e.g. Ghent,+Belgium

                Put image links where appropriate in text and also in the links field.

                Recount at least one interesting story about a famous person associated with an area.
                
                Include natural headings and paragraphs in MARKDOWN format.
                Use unordered lists as appropriate.
                Start any headings at Header 4
                Embed images in text, with max width of ${IMAGE_WIDTH}px.
                Be sure to include informative caption and alt text for each image.
